# AI-Based Crop Disease Prediction System

This repository contains an AI-based solution for predicting crop diseases using images of infected plants. The system leverages transfer learning with ResNet50 to classify diseases and provides pesticide recommendations using a supplemental dataset.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Predicts crop diseases from images using deep learning.
- **Transfer Learning**: Uses ResNet50 for efficient training with limited data.
- **Pesticide Recommendations**: Provides detailed recommendations for controlling diseases based on a curated dataset.
- **Visualization**: Displays predicted results with images for easy analysis.
